Chondroitin Sulfate Regulates and Controls Gut Microbiota Sugar-Bile Acid Metabolism to Activate Skeletal Muscle Regeneratio
Abstract
Glucocorticoids are widely used in clinical scenarios such as autoimmune diseases, organ transplant rejection, and severe infections due to their powerful immunosuppressive effects, 
but their long-term use is often accompanied by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, which lacks effective interventions at present. 
A previous study found that duck bone–derived chondroitin sulfate (DCS) intervention significantly enhanced muscle mass and functional performance in glucocorticoid-treated mice.
In this study, mechanism of DCS action was systematically assessed in a mouse model of dexamethasone-induced myopathy through a combination of multi-omics techniques such as histopathology, 1
6S rRNA sequencing and targeted metabolomics. The results showed that DCS significantly enhanced muscle mass, exercise capacity and metabolic level and repaired muscle tissue structure in mice in a dose-dependent manner. Gut microbiome analysis revealed that DCS reshaped the structure of gut microbiota. 
Lactobacillus johnsonii Z-RW was identified as the key responsive strain, and its abundance was significantly and positively correlated with several indicators of muscle function.
Metabolomic analysis further revealed that DCS facilitated the enrichment of L. johnsonii Z-RW, 
which reduced the gut metabolic balance of sugars and bile acids (particularly free secondary bile acids) ratio via bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. 
This metabolic shift was accompanied by a significant upregulation of the Pax7-mediated satellite cell activation pathway and the Nmrk2-mediated NAD⁺ biosynthesis pathway, 
ultimately leading to restoration of skeletal muscle repair function. In summary, DCS demonstrated its potential as a candidate for microecological intervention in glucocorticoid-associated myopathy by promoting targeted enrichment of the functional strain L. johnsonii Z-RW, reshaping the intestinal flora-metabolism interaction network, decreasing sugar-to-bile acid ratio (SBR), and modulating the metabolic homeostasis of the gut-muscle axis. It also provides a novel strategy of multi-targeted prevention and treatment in clinical practice.
